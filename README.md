# Summary
Traditional TOTP (Time-based One-Time Passwords) which relies on symmetric and with or not used asymetric primitive cryptographic keys like [FIDO](https://fidoalliance.org/fido2/) can be vulnerable to interception, bypass, or even QC can finding corrected ECC/RAS private key from public key such like $$(Q=k*P)$$, especially in a future with powerful quantum computers.
