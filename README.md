# Introducing [S-OTP](https://github.com/ChyKusuma/Lamport_W-OTS_S-OTP/wiki/What-is-S%E2%80%90OTP): A Modern, Post-Quantum One-Time Password System

Traditional TOTP (Time-based One-Time Passwords) which relies on symmetric and with or not used asymetric primitive cryptographic keys like this can be vulnerable to interception, bypass, or even derivied corrected private key from public key, especially in a future with powerful quantum computers.
